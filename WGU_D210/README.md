# üìä Summary of WGU D210: Data Dashboard and Storytelling

This Jupyter notebook documents the development and deployment of an **interactive data dashboard** using healthcare data. The primary focus of the project is to build a visual storytelling experience that enables users to explore medical and patient data in an intuitive and meaningful way. The dashboard serves both technical and non-technical stakeholders by offering a clear interface for interpreting complex health-related variables, with the goal of improving decision-making in hospital and patient care settings.

## üõ†Ô∏è Dashboard Development and Usage

The notebook outlines the key steps to build and install the dashboard using Python libraries such as **Streamlit**, **Plotly**, **Pandas**, and **Seaborn**. The dashboard includes several interactive features that allow users to filter by variables such as `Marital Status`, `Initial Days`, and `Service Type`. The user interface allows for dynamic exploration of data distributions, boxplots, and bar charts. It is designed to provide actionable insights based on patient behavior and outcomes‚Äîlike identifying correlations between hospital stay duration and charges, or how readmission risk relates to service type.

The dashboard is modular, allowing future additions such as filtering by time or adding comparative views across demographic categories. Installation instructions are clearly laid out with commands to install dependencies and run the dashboard locally using Streamlit.

## üìà Visual Storytelling and Data Representations

The storytelling portion of the project is delivered through visual narratives using **Plotly** charts and other data representation techniques. It highlights key insights, such as how specific hospital services (e.g., `MRI`, `CTScan`, `BloodWork`) impact overall charges and patient experiences. Variables are carefully selected and transformed to ensure clarity, with categorical columns encoded properly and continuous variables standardized or normalized when needed.

Visualizations like histograms, bar plots, and scatter plots support the narrative by emphasizing important correlations and outliers. This strengthens the user's ability to quickly draw conclusions from the data and contributes to the dashboard‚Äôs educational and operational value.

## üß† Reflection and Insight

In the final reflection, the notebook connects the dashboard‚Äôs purpose with broader data storytelling goals: to **empower users with clarity**, support **data-driven decision-making**, and provide **transparent health insights**. It emphasizes the importance of using interactive controls and clean design to make analytics approachable. Additionally, the author discusses how the dashboard could evolve, including potential real-time integration or use in public health campaigns.

Overall, the notebook exemplifies the intersection of technical dashboard development and strategic storytelling in healthcare analytics.
