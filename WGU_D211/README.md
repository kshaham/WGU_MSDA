# Advanced Data Acquisition

The project titled "Advanced Data Acquisition" focuses on creating a comprehensive dashboard using datasets from the WGU medical dataset and the 2017-2018 National Health & Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) from the CDC. The primary objective is to analyze and visualize patient demographics and health conditions to provide insights that can improve patient care and reduce hospital readmission rates. The dashboard integrates data from both datasets, referred to as WGU patients and NHS patients, to compare and contrast various health metrics and demographic trends.

The dashboard is designed to be interactive and user-friendly, allowing stakeholders to explore patient demographics and condition metrics through visualizations. It includes features such as age and gender filters, which enable users to focus on specific patient groups. The dashboard's visualizations highlight key differences between the WGU and NHANES datasets, such as the higher prevalence of older patients in the WGU dataset and the significant differences in condition rates like diabetes and high blood pressure. These insights can guide resource allocation and strategic initiatives to enhance patient care.

The project also involves significant data preparation and transformation steps to ensure the datasets are compatible and ready for analysis. This includes converting categorical data to boolean values, renaming columns for clarity, and ensuring referential integrity through the use of primary and foreign keys. The analysis leverages SQL for data manipulation and Tableau for creating the dashboard, showcasing the power of combining data engineering and visualization tools to derive actionable insights from complex datasets.

Overall, the project demonstrates the importance of data-driven decision-making in healthcare. By providing a detailed view of patient demographics and health conditions, the dashboard serves as a valuable tool for healthcare providers to identify trends, allocate resources effectively, and ultimately improve patient outcomes. The insights gained from this analysis can lead to targeted interventions and policies that address the specific needs of different patient populations.
