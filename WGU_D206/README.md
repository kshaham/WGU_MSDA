# ðŸ©º Summary of D206 Exploratory Analysis

This Jupyter notebook outlines a comprehensive approach to cleaning, exploring, and preparing a raw medical dataset for further analysis. The dataset includes various health and demographic variables such as age, vitamin levels, income, number of children, lifestyle habits, and healthcare utilization metrics. The analysis begins with data loading and initial inspection using Pandas to understand the structure, data types, and any potential issues such as null values or duplicate entries.

To gain a clearer view of data quality, the notebook uses summary statistics, missing value counts, and checks for duplicate rows based on general entries and the unique `Customer_id` column. Visualizations like histograms and heatmaps are employed to identify missing data patterns and distributions of numerical columns. Outlier detection is also performed using seaborn boxplots across key variables including age, vitamin D levels, income, and total charges. These exploratory steps highlight data inconsistencies that guide subsequent cleaning decisions.

Cleaning operations include dropping non-essential columns (`UID`, `Interaction`, and an unnamed index column), imputing missing values in columns such as `Age` and `Children`, and ensuring proper data types for downstream analysis. For instance, the mean of the `Age` column is used for imputation, while `Children` null values are replaced with 0. The notebook also includes procedures to convert categorical data into numerically interpretable formats for modeling.

The final sections of the notebook prepare the dataset for machine learning applications. After standardizing numerical features with `StandardScaler`, dimensionality reduction is applied via Principal Component Analysis (PCA), which helps reduce feature complexity while preserving variance. The PCA-transformed dataset is visualized to understand the separation of data points in lower dimensions. This summary demonstrates a rigorous and methodical approach to preprocessing medical data, making it ready for predictive modeling or clustering in future work.
